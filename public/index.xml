      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea was to have an easy way to post short writings.&#xA;I was already using Obsidian, I already had a domain, I already had a Github account, and I recently learned about Hugo in one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck&#34;&gt;NetworkChuck&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s videos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I set out to try and make the process for publishing my written out thoughts as smooth and frictionless as possible; because friction is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; the problem, right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As one does with sidequests, letting them become the actual main quest, it took me some considerable stumbling around before I worked up the courage to install Hugo, initialize a new repo, and try and get a test post published on it.&#xA;Naturally, the first and most important task was picking a theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
