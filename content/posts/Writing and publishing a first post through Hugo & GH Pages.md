The idea was to have an easy way to post short writings.
I was already using Obsidian, I already had a domain, I already had a Github account, and I recently learned about Hugo in one of [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck)'s videos.

I set out to try and make the process for publishing my written out thoughts as smooth and frictionless as possible; because friction is _always_ the problem, right.

As one does with sidequests, letting them become the actual main quest, it took me some considerable stumbling around before I worked up the courage to install Hugo, initialize a new repo, and try and get a test post published on it.
Naturally, the first and most important task was picking a theme.

What I _should've_ done though would be to read through the Hugo docs a bit more and maybe also the example `.toml` provided in the theme I picked. _(the one thing I did right from the get go I think)_
And also the Github Pages documentation where it very clearly and unambiguously states how to name your repo when initializing it. _**hint hint**_ 

So far the wins of this project are:
- Get a hugo site live on my domain through Github.
- Wrangle git and get some basic commands in my working memory.
- Un-sidetrack yourself fast when falling for a visual rabbit hole.

As for the learning opportunities, they are:
	- As mentioned under the wins, visual rabbit holes are my nemesis; picking a theme for Hugo, making the `.toml` files show with color coding in VSCode, you name it. — Stay alert and leave the visual finicking for later. 
	- RTFM — Read The Fucking Manual. It's a good thing to get to action fast, but a bit _more_ doc reading wouldn't hurt.
