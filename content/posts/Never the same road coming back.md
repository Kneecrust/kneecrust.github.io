Multiple people have mentioned how I tend to _zig-zag_ my way towards my destination. And I've replied to each of them that this is because I believe it's the shortest & fastest route. 

When returning however, I tend to take a more linear route with less turns, much to the amusement of those calling me out earlier on my zig-zagging.  
## It's not about how you're getting there, it's about where you're going â€” _and what for_
When you were a kid and you were going to the beach with your parents, the trip there felt like it took ages, but the way back flew past in a (sea)breeze; I think that my approach for zig-zagging, or not, is similar in a sense.

Leaving for a destination is usually with a purpose.
And the more important this purpose, the more excited, anxious, or nervous one might become in anticipation of the moment of arrival.

I see myself as quite excitable, and coupled with my dislike of wasting time I'm prone to speeding along, doing whatever I can to shave off some 'vital' milliseconds. And I believe that my _zigging_ and _zagging_ is helping me with just that.
## Home, is where I want to be, pick me up and turn me round
But, and it's a big one...
What if my aforementioned beliefs about speeding along, and saving time are just a mental construct I built to avoid being confronted?
And instead of being a _zoomy boi_ I'm actually still that small kid, dragging his feet on the way to school; _home is where I want to be._
## All that to say
I'm happy to report that over the past few weeks, I _have_ occasionally been taking the same way home as the one I went.
Nothing spectacular happened, I arrived just as well.

More remarkable, I've also, _very occasionally_, been taking a more linear way over. And I've been enjoying those extra milliseconds, **_unshaven_**.
